In this case we will implement a second more complex attack, which will use brute force to break the encrypted message, since in this case the first security property that flow encryption systems must comply with, the period of The encryption sequence is not at least as long as the length of the text to be encrypted. The difference with the previous example is that we are going to use a repetitive key instead of a simple byte, so we will need some smarter method to break it than simple brute force.
